# CODINGSAMURAI Internship - Project Submission

This repository contains the two tasks completed as part of the Coding Samurai Internship (Jan-Feb 2026). The goal was to build simple, working, and clean web projects without using heavy frameworks.

Task 1 - Personal Portfolio Website

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Folder: portfolio-project

This is a basic portfolio website with the following sections:

About Me

Projects

Contact

Small stats section

Basic responsive layout

The focus was on keeping the design clean, readable, and easy to navigate. Task 2 - To-Do List Application

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (LocalStorage) Folder: To-Do project

This is a simple to-do application where the

user can:

Add tasks

Edit tasks

Delete tasks

Mark tasks as complete

See total and completed task count

Have the data saved in the browser using localStorage

The UI is minimal and aims to look like something a beginner-intermediate developer would make without any libraries. Repository Link
